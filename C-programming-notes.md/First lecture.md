# Computer Software

 **Computer software** is a programming code executed on a **_computer processor_**. Programming code can be some **_machine level code_ or _high level code_** written for a specific operating system.

Compuer software provides a dependable layer for the _hardware manufacturer_ which in turn creates an efficient environment for **_programmers_**  to create smaller programs.

**There are two types of computer softwares:**
- System Software
- Application Software

## System Software

 **System software** is a set of programs that **control and manage the operations of a _computer hardware_.** They are designed to control the operations and **extend the functionality of a computer system.** eg. OS, Programming Language, Communication Softwares, etc.


##Application Software
 **Application Software** acts as a **mediator between the end user and the system software.** It is mostly created to **perform a specific task for a user.** This is also called application package where the system is installed on some kind of storage device like CD, DVD flash drive, etc. eg word processor, spredsheet browser, database, etc.

# Different types of SDLC models

## 1. Waterfall model

 This model is generally used to create applications when **user requirements are well known**. That is even if the user decides to change the requirement _the overall process of development will not be changed_.

Following is the **components** for the waterfall model:

## 2.Prototyping Model

 This model is used ehen the **user requirements are not clear** i.e. if the user provides vague explanations for the requirements of the product then this model can be used to create a prototype of a software that helps the user to _evaluate whether the software/prototype can be the final product_.

Following is the **components** for the prototype model:

## 3.Spiral model

 This model is used to **identify the risk involved in a particular project**. So, the models are developed in a **incremental manner to create different prototypes in regards with the risk factor.**

Following is the **components** for the spiral model:

# Language processor

 **Langussage processor** is a special type of program that **converts or translates program codes into machine code (binary).** There are three types of language processors:

1. Compiler
2. Assembler
3. Interpretor

## Compiler
 It is a program that converts the **entire source code into machine level code at once.** It generates only after scanning the whole code. eg. C, C++, Java uses compiler to convert high level code into machine level code.


## Interpreter
 It converts **source code into machine level code line by line.** _The total time to analyse the code increases where as the debugging process will be easier as the program will be continued only afer the errors are delt with._ eg. python interpretor, matlab interpretor.


## Assembler
 It is used to convert the **assembly level code into machine level code.** Assembler usede 'upcode' where the assembly level instructions are present and the translates these instructions into the machine level code.
